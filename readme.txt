I used Xcode for this entire project, so I would just open the FinalProject.xcodeproj to check out the src code, compile, and run

The executable is just called FinalProject

** Very important ** 

Place the raws folder in the root directory. Throughout the application I reference raw files using the path “/raws/IMG”.. So the raws folder has to be in the root path


Thanks for everything Dr.Bernstein!
